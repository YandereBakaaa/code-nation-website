          <div id=boxunderline><h1>So who am I?</h1></div>
                While my background may not be filled with a long history of coding, it is in fact filled with me using computers for a lot of my time growing up and even more so as an adult.
                
                I have always had a thing, a passion even, for technology. Everything in the tech world fascinated me even since I was young but I never truly pursued a path in an IT career until more recently.
                
                I came to Code Nation in order to get my foot in the door with a career in tech and it is becoming clearer now that coding is an extremely fulfilling path to take, having only just 3 weeks of practice.

        <h1>What is the purpose of IT in a modern business?</h1>
        <p>Information technology has played an important part in the U.S. and global economies. Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing and market intelligence. 
            IT plays an integral role in every industry, helping companies improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.[1]
 
        <div class="box1">
        <ul>    <!--1.1 Purpose of IT in a modern business-->
            IT can cover a wide range of things such as:
            
            <li>Digital Security</li>

    <div><h3>What tools contribute to a successful project?</h3></div><!--1.2 Cont.-->
    <div><p>
            Any kind of cloud storage will be immensely helpful when working on a project, something such as Google Drive or One Drive.
            A management tool such as Trello or Microsoft Project will allow for yourself and other collaborating members to keep track of all current tasks, who is doing what and when things need doing.
    </p></div>

    <!--1.3 Planning phase-->
    <div><h1>How did I plan this website?</h1></div>
    <div><h3> Initial plans.</h3></div>
    
    <div><p>The initial planning for the website will begin in Trello, breaking down the required stages bit by bit, building it up and put it together again. Using Trello will allow me to keep track of everything as I go and allow me to assign tasks as necessary.
    </p></div>

    <div><h3>Execution.</h3></div>
    <div><p>After researching all the required materials and gathering all the information I need, I can begin building my website by applying all research into the code.
    Having used Trello in my planning it will allow me to easily move the information I researched into my website meaning the process will be as painless as possible.
    </p></div>

    <!--1.4 Risk taking.-->
    <h1>Taking risks and how it affects projects.</h1>
    <p>A risk doesn't mean a make or break situation every time but it can still make an impact on a project if something fails to happen, such as missed deadlines can deal a big blow to a project depending on how important that deadline was.
    There are many risks that exist during an entire project and it's important to be aware of them as you move along, an example of some of these risks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Performance risk, the risk that the project will fail to produce results consistent with project specifications.</li>
        <li>Schedule risk, the risk that activities will take longer than expected. Slippages in schedule typically increase costs and, also, delay the receipt of project benefits, with a possible loss of competitive advantage.</li>
        <li>Cost risk, typically escalation of project costs due to poor cost estimating accuracy and scope creep.</li>

    </ul>

    <!--1.5 The right tool for the job-->
    <h1>Selecting the right tool for the job is important.</h1>
    <p>There are a lot of factors to take in when deciding which software you need to use for your project, an important aspect is the management tools you have a vast selection of, all offering their own pros and cons.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Collaboration</li>
    <p>Collaboration is a very important point to consider depending on your project, having the ability of multiple people working together seamlessly is a fantastic concept. However sometimes you don't need that kind of feature if you're doing a solo project in which case a different tool with other focuses may be a better shot.</p>
    <li>Ease of use</li>
    <p>An easy to use program is always better for most people and that's no exception when it comes to project management, a big complicated program can be frustrating to figure out or just downright demotivating so it's important to make sure what you're using is clear and concise with its functions.</p>
    <li>Integration</li>
    <p>If you already have an existing product you need to think about how a new software will impact the day to day tasks you currently do, it's important to understand a new product inside and out before making the switch as most of the time you might not realise what will be affected until it's too late.</p>
    <p>These examples are just to name a few but the conditions for required software can vary so much it's impossible to give a solution that fits all, it's important to take in all factors before finally committing to a product.</p>
    </ul>

    <!--1.6 Analyze chosen technologies-->
    <h1>Trello Analysis</h1>
    <p>Trello has helped me keep track of tasks that require finishing as I've planned through making a website, it has allowed me to remember each individual task without having to think back to previous topics.
    As well as allowing me to keep track during my website project it has allowed me to collaborate with multiple people while creating a game for our first assignment. You can view the trello board for my game development <a href="https://trello.com/b/vtbjix8m/pythons" target="_blank"> [HERE]</a> and you can see my trello for my website <a href="https://trello.com/b/mr7ZFJiW/website-design" target="_blank">[HERE].</a></p>
    
    <h1>How can git help me?</h1>
    <p>As git is a version control system, it would allow me to keep track of a project and its many changing parts whenever I need to, even letting me make small changes without having to change the base code every time. It’s useful for coordinating work among multiple people on a project, and for tracking progress over time by saving “checkpoints”. You could use it while writing an essay, or to track changes to artwork and design files. [1]
    Git also allows for a very good sense of collaboration with other programmers as it stops multiple people from making changes to the same part of code and causing immense conflicts, instead it allows for a controlled environment</p>

    <h1>What is GDPR and how will it affect a project?</h1><!--1.7 GDPR and the impact it has-->
    <p>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU legislation that regulates personal data that has been stored and how it can be used by businesses.
    One of the primary objectives of GDPR is adjusting the legal regulations concerning the processing and protection of personal data to better fit the challenges of technological development and globalisation which have facilitated the unprecedented availability and pervasive use of personal data. Just to be clear, by personal data I mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person—including identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.<a href="https://www.monterail.com/blog/introduction-to-gdpr-for-digital-companies" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
    
    <h1>Minimising the effect of GDPR on a project.</h1>
    <p>Since a service provider cannot avoid being subject to GDPR by changing its location, the only way to minimise the impact of these new regulations is by minimising the scope of the processing—for example by collecting less personal data, avoiding the processing of sensitive data categories (including health records, data on racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, etc.), and limiting the scope of purposes of the processing and transfers of personal data to other entities. <a href="https://www.monterail.com/blog/introduction-to-gdpr-for-digital-companies" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
